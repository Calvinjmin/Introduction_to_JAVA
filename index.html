        <h1>An Introduction to Java Programming - Calvin Min</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This website is a great resource for those who are trying to learn Java in a concise manner.
            My goal is for each chapter of the website to cover a board range of topics within the over-arching one.
            Each chapter will contain information, examples, and hands-on material that will help the learning process.

            Note: Some exercises will link to either <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerank</a> or
            <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> These sites are great resources that will help you practice
            your skills in JAVA and many other languages. I highly recommend creating accounts on these
            websites and completing as many problems as you can.
