# An introduction to Java Programming - Calvin Min
## Purpose
This website will be a great resource for those who are trying to learn Java in a concise manner.
As a current undergraduate student at the University of Virginia, I find that teaching others how to code
helps solidify my understanding of the language.

My goal is for each chapter to cover a board range of topics within the over-arching one.
Each chapter will contain information, examples, and hands-on material that will help the learning process.  

Note: Some exercises will link to either [hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com) or [leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
These sites are great resources that will help you practice your skills in JAVA and many other languages.
I highly recommend creating accounts on these websites and completing as many problems as you can.
